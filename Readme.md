# Project Optimizations

This document outlines various optimizations implemented to improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of the project.

## Batching Database Writes
- Current Approach: Each API call triggers a separate database write for a single entry.
- Optimized Approach: Process data in batches to reduce the number of database writes.
  - Preprocess the data and store it in an array.
  - Use Prisma's `createMany` with nested writes method to perform a single write operation for multiple entries, improving efficiency.

## Message Queues and Worker Pool
- Implement message queues to delegate asynchronous tasks for better scalability.
- Use worker pool to handle these tasks and distribute the load to a worker.
- Enable distributed caching to reduce load on the database and improve response times.

## Retry Mechanisms
- Handle interruptions in processes by implementing retry mechanisms.

## Database Sharding and Horizontal Scaling
- Implement database sharding to split data across multiple databases or nodes based on specific criteria, improving read/write performance.
- Enable horizontal scaling to handle increased traffic by adding more servers or nodes.

By incorporating these optimizations, the project can achieve better performance, scalability, and reliability while minimizing resource usage.
